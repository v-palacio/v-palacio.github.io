I am **Viviana Palacio Betancur**, a computational materials scientist whose research integrates theory, simulation, and data science to uncover the physical principles that govern order and dynamics in complex soft matter. I am currently a **Beckman Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**, working with **[Prof. Nick Jackson](https://thejacksonlab.web.illinois.edu/wp/)** on machine-learning-guided modeling of liquid-crystalline and anisotropic materials.

My work develops **multiscale frameworks** that connect molecular identity, interfacial structure, and macroscopic behavior across length and time scales. By combining **continuum theories, coarse-grained molecular simulations, and physics-informed machine learning**, I aim to establish predictive and interpretable models of self-organization in chemically heterogeneous materials. These approaches enable the **inverse design** of responsive soft systems, with applications spanning functional films, biomimetic assemblies, and food as soft matter.

I earned my **Ph.D. in [Molecular Engineering](https://pme.uchicago.edu/)** from the **University of Chicago**, advised by **[Prof. Juan de Pablo](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/juan-de-pablo)**, where I developed computational methods for a variety of liquid crystalline systems exploring chirality, confinement, and coupling with external fields out of equilibrium. My training bridges computational physics, materials chemistry, and applied mathematics, and reflects a commitment to **open-source, interdisciplinary science** that links simulation and experiment.

Looking forward, my research group will focus on developing **data-driven theoretical frameworks** for nonequilibrium soft materials and on advancing open, reproducible modeling tools that empower broad scientific collaboration.
